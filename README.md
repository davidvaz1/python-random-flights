# Random Flights in Python

This code can be run, but pls drop me a comment, telling me you have run the code. Pls also mention _where_ you have run the code. **Thanks so much!**
### When you copypaste all the code and run it, you will get a `print()` output with a random flight name, random flight number, and random runway direction and number
